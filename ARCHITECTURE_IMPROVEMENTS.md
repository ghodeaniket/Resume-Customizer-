# Architecture Improvements Implementation

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Service Registry Update
- Updated the service registry to support all service types
- Removed dependency on legacy factory pattern
- Configured service creation with proper dependency injection
- Fixed issues in service implementations to work with the repository layer

### 2. Standardized Logging Strategy
- Enhanced logger utility with structured logging support
- Added log rotation with winston-daily-rotate-file
- Created a comprehensive request logger middleware
- Implemented sensitive data masking in logs
- Added correlation IDs for request tracking

### 3. Integration Testing Framework
- Created a setup for integration tests with mock service injection
- Implemented database reset between tests
- Added example integration tests for the ResumeService
- Created helpers for test data generation and cleanup

### 4. API Documentation
- Implemented OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Created centralized schema definitions for common types
- Added route annotations for API endpoints
- Configured security definitions for JWT authentication
- Made API documentation available through a web UI

## How to Apply Changes

1. Run the `apply-architecture-updates.sh` script to apply all changes
2. Install new dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly
4. Start the server and check the API documentation at `/api-docs`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Service Migration**
   - All service implementations have been updated
   - Service registry now uses dependency injection for all services
   - Legacy service factory can be removed when ready

2. **Add More Tests**
   - Create additional integration tests for all services
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical workflows
   - Consider adding performance tests

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Implement global error handling across the application
   - Add consistent error reporting for all services
   - Consider implementing retry strategies for external services

4. **Finalize Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation for all endpoints
   - Add examples and sample responses
   - Create developer guides for common tasks

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Testability**
   - Services can be easily mocked and tested in isolation
   - Integration tests verify service interactions
   - Clearer separation of concerns makes unit testing easier

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Standardized error types across the application
   - Consistent error responses for API clients
   - Improved debugging through standardized logging

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Clear architecture with proper separation of concerns
   - Explicit dependencies make code easier to understand
   - Standardized patterns reduce cognitive load for developers

4. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Services can be easily extracted to separate processes
   - Enhanced monitoring through structured logging
   - Better request tracking with correlation IDs
