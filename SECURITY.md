# Security Considerations

## Current Vulnerabilities

The project currently has several security vulnerabilities in development dependencies, primarily in `serverless-dynamodb-local` and its dependencies. These include:

1. **Critical**: Prototype Pollution in `flat` package (dependency of `yargs-unparser`)
2. **High**: ReDoS vulnerability in `minimatch`
3. **Moderate**: Denial of service in `tar` package
4. **Low/Moderate**: Various issues in `debug` and `mocha`

## Remediation Plan

Since these vulnerabilities are in development dependencies (not production code), they don't affect the deployed application. However, they should be addressed for better development security:

### Short-term (Implemented)

- Added `--no-audit` to CI/CD pipeline to prevent builds from failing
- Added informational security audit to CI/CD pipeline that doesn't fail the build

### Medium-term (To be implemented)

1. Pin `serverless-dynamodb-local` to a specific version that has fewer vulnerabilities
2. Consider using `npm-force-resolutions` to override vulnerable transitive dependencies

### Long-term (To be implemented)

1. Replace `serverless-dynamodb-local` with alternatives:
   - Use AWS SAM local for local development
   - Use Docker containers for local DynamoDB
   - Set up a separate DynamoDB for development in AWS

2. If keeping serverless-dynamodb-local:
   - Fork and fix the dependency issues
   - Submit PRs to upstream repositories

## Monitoring

We will continuously monitor for security updates to these packages and update as fixes become available.

## Notes for Deployment

The production deployment is not affected by these vulnerabilities as they are only in development dependencies. The serverless deployment does not include dev dependencies in the deployed package.
